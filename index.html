        </h1>
        <p class="p1">Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other).<br> Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.

    <h2>Humans to Mars</h2>
    <h3>Like the Moon, Mars is a rich destination for scientific discovery and a driver of technologies that will enable humans to travel and explore far from Earth.</h3>
    <p id="we">Mars remains our horizon goal for human exploration because it is one of the only other places we know in the solar system where life may have existed. What we learn about the Red Planet will tell us more about our Earth’s past and future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our home planet.</p>

    <h1>Transient atmospheric phenomena</h1>
    <p>
        Early telescopic observers noted instances in which Martian surface features were temporarily obscured. They observed both white and yellow obscurations that were correctly interpreted as due to condensed gas and dust, respectively.<br> Telescopic observers also noted periodic disappearances of all dark markings, usually around southern summer.<br> Again they were correctly interpreted as the result of global dust  Spacecraft observations have confirmed that hazes, clouds, and fogs commonly veil the surface.<br>
